//! # Event
//!
//! The `event` module provides the functionality to read keyboard, mouse and terminal resize events.
//!
//! * The [`read`](fn.read.html) function returns an [`Event`](enum.Event.html) immediately
//! (if available) or blocks until an [`Event`](enum.Event.html) is available.
//!
//! * The [`poll`](fn.poll.html) function allows you to check if there is or isn't an [`Event`](enum.Event.html) available
//! within the given period of time. In other words - if subsequent call to the [`read`](fn.read.html)
//! function will block or not.
//!
//! It's **not allowed** to call these functions from different threads or combine them with the
//! [`EventStream`](struct.EventStream.html). You're allowed to either:
//!
//! * use the [`read`](fn.read.html) & [`poll`](fn.poll.html) functions on any, but same, thread
//! * or the [`EventStream`](struct.EventStream.html).
//!
//! **Make sure to enable [raw mode](../terminal/index.html#raw-mode) in order for keyboard events to work properly**
//!
//! ## Mouse Events
//!
//! Mouse events are not enabled by default. You have to enable them with the
//! [`EnableMouseCapture`](struct.EnableMouseCapture.html) command. See [Command API](../index.html#command-api)
//! for more information.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! Blocking read:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use crossterm::event::{read, Event};
//!
//! fn print_events() -> crossterm::Result<()> {
//!     loop {
//!         // `read()` blocks until an `Event` is available
//!         match read()? {
//!             Event::FocusGained => println!("FocusGained"),
//!             Event::FocusLost => println!("FocusLost"),
//!             Event::Key(event) => println!("{:?}", event),
//!             Event::Mouse(event) => println!("{:?}", event),
//!             #[cfg(feature = "bracketed-paste")]
//!             Event::Paste(data) => println!("{:?}", data),
//!             Event::Resize(width, height) => println!("New size {}x{}", width, height),
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Non-blocking read:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! use crossterm::event::{poll, read, Event};
//!
//! fn print_events() -> crossterm::Result<()> {
//!     loop {
//!         // `poll()` waits for an `Event` for a given time period
//!         if poll(Duration::from_millis(500))? {
//!             // It's guaranteed that the `read()` won't block when the `poll()`
//!             // function returns `true`
//!             match read()? {
//!                 Event::FocusGained => println!("FocusGained"),
//!                 Event::FocusLost => println!("FocusLost"),
//!                 Event::Key(event) => println!("{:?}", event),
//!                 Event::Mouse(event) => println!("{:?}", event),
//!                 #[cfg(feature = "bracketed-paste")]
//!                 Event::Paste(data) => println!("Pasted {:?}", data),
//!                 Event::Resize(width, height) => println!("New size {}x{}", width, height),
//!             }
//!         } else {
//!             // Timeout expired and no `Event` is available
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Check the [examples](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/tree/master/examples) folder for more of
//! them (`event-*`).
